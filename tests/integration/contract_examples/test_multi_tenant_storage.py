def test_multi_tenant_storage(setup_validators):
    """
    This test verifies the functionality of a multi-tenant storage contract. It deploys two separate storage contracts
    and a multi-tenant storage contract that manages them. The test aims to:

    1. Deploy two different storage contracts with initial storage values.
    2. Deploy a multi-tenant storage contract that can interact with multiple storage contracts.
    3. Test the ability of the multi-tenant contract to update and retrieve storage values for multiple users
       across different storage contracts.
    4. Ensure the multi-tenant contract correctly assigns users to storage contracts and manages their data.

    This test demonstrates contract-to-contract interactions and multi-tenant data management.
